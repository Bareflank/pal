       "
       The Interrupt Pin register is a read-only register that identifies the
       legacy interrupt Message(s) the Function uses (see Section 6.1 for
       further details). Valid values are 01h, 02h, 03h, and 04h that map to
       legacy interrupt Messages for INTA, INTB, INTC, and INTD respectively. A
       value of 00h indicates that the Function uses no legacy interrupt
       Message(s). The values 05h through FFh are Reserved.  PCI Express
       defines one legacy interrupt Message for a single Function device and up
       to four legacy interrupt Messages for a Multi-Function Device. For a
       single Function device, only INTA may be used.  Any Function on a
       Multi-Function Device can use any of the INTx Messages. If a device
       implements a single legacy interrupt Message, it must be INTA; if it
       implements two legacy interrupt Messages, they must be INTA and INTB;
       and so forth. For a Multi-Function Device, all Functions may use the
       same INTx Message or each may have its own (up to a maximum of four
       Functions) or any combination thereof. A single Function can never
       generate an interrupt request on more than one INTx Message.
