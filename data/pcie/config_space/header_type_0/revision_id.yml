  purpose: |
       "
       The Revision ID Register is HwInit and the value in this register
       specifies a Function specific revision identifier. The value is chosen
       by the vendor. Zero is an acceptable value. The Device ID, in
       conjunction with the Vendor ID and Revision ID, are used as one
       mechanism for software to determine which driver should be loaded. The
       vendor must ensure that the chosen values do not result in the use of an
       incompatible device driver.
