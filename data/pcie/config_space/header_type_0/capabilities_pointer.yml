  long_name: "Capabilities Pointer Register"
  purpose: |
       "
       This register is used to point to a linked list of capabilities
       implemented by this Function. Since all PCI Express Functions are
       required to implement both the PCI Power Management Capability and the
       PCI Express Capability structure, these structures must be included
       somewhere in the linked list; this register may point to either of these
       Capability Structures or to an optional Capability Structure implemented
       by the Function. The bottom two bits are Reserved and must be set to
       00b. Software must mask these bits off before using this register as a
       pointer in Configuration Space to the first entry of a linked list of
       new capabilities.
