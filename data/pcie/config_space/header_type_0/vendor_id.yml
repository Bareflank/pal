  purpose: |
       "
       The Vendor ID register is HwInit and the value in this register
       identifies the manufacturer of the Function. In keeping with PCI-SIG
       procedures, valid vendor identifiers must be allocated by the PCI-SIG to
       ensure uniqueness. Each vendor must have at least one Vendor ID. It is
       recommended that software read the Vendor ID register to determine if a
       Function is present, where a value of FFFFh indicates that no Function
       is present.
