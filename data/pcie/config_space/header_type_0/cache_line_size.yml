       "
       The Cache Line Size register is programmed by the system firmware or the
       operating system to system cache line size. However, note that legacy
       PCI-compatible software may not always be able to program this register
       correctly especially in the case of Hot-Plug devices. This read-write
       register is implemented for legacy compatibility purposes but has no
       effect on any PCI Express device behavior. For PCI Express to PCI/PCI-X
       Bridges, refer to the [PCIe-to-PCI-PCI-X-Bridge] for requirements for
       this register. The default value of this register is 00h.
