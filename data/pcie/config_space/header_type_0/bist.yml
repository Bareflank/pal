       "
       This register is used for control and status of BIST. Functions that do
       not support BIST must hardwire the register to 00h. A Function whose
       BIST is invoked must not prevent normal operation of the PCI Express
       Link. Table 7-7 describes the bits in the register and Figure 7-9 shows
       the register layout.

                  This field encodes the status of the most recent test. A
                  value of 0000b means that the Function has passed its test.
                  Non-zero values mean the Function failed. Function-specific
                  failure codes can be encoded in the non-zero values.  This
                  fieldâ€™s value is only meaningful when BIST Capable is Set and
                  Start BIST is Clear. Default value of this field is 0000b.
                  This field must be hardwired to 0000b if BIST Capable is
                  Clear.

                  If BIST Capable is Set, Set this bit to invoke BIST. The
                  Function resets the bit when BIST is complete. Software is
                  permitted to fail the device if this bit is not Clear (BIST
                  is not complete) 2 seconds after it had been Set.  Writing
                  this bit to 0b has no effect.  This bit must be hardwired to
                  0b if BIST Capable is Clear.

                  When Set, this bit indicates that the Function supports BIST.
                  When Clear, the Function does not support BIST.
