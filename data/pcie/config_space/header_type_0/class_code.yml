       The Class Code Register is read-only and is used to identify the generic
       operation of the Function and, in some cases, a specific register level
       programming interface. The register layout is shown in Figure 7-7 and
       described in Table 7-5 . Encodings for base class, sub-class, and
       programming interface are provided in the [PCI-Code-and-ID]. All
       unspecified encodings are Reserved.
