       "
       The Device ID register is HwInit and the value in this register
       identifies the particular Function. The Device ID must be allocated by
       the vendor. The Device ID, in conjunction with the Vendor ID and
       Revision ID, are used as one mechanism for software to determine which
       driver should be loaded. The vendor must ensure that the chosen values
       do not result in the use of an incompatible device driver.
