       This register identifies the layout of the second part of the predefined
       header (beginning at byte 10h in Configuration Space) and also whether
       or not the Device might contain multiple Functions. The register layout
       is shown in Figure 7-8 and Table 7-6 describes the bits in the register.

                  This field identifies the layout of the second part of the
                  predefined header.  For Functions that implement a Type 0
                  Configuration Space Header the encoding 000 0000b must be
                  used.  For Functions that implement a Type 1 Configuration
                  Space Header the encoding 000 0001b must be used.

                  When Set, indicates that the Device may contain multiple
                  Functions, but not necessarily. Software is permitted to
                  probe for Functions other than Function 0. When Clear,
                  software must not probe for Functions other than Function 0
                  unless explicitly indicated by another mechanism, such as an
                  ARI or SR-IOV Extended Capability structure. Except where
                  stated otherwise, it is recommended that this bit be Set if
                  there are multiple Functions, and Clear if there is only one
                  Function.
