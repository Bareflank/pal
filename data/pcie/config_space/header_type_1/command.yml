                  Functions are prevented from asserting INTx interrupts.  Any
                  INTx emulation interrupts already asserted by the Function
                  must be deasserted when this bit is Set.  As described in

                  must, if asserted, be deasserted using the appropriate
                  Deassert_INTx message(s) when this bit is Set.  Only the INTx
                  virtual wire interrupt(s) associated with the Function(s) for
