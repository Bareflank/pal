  purpose: |
       "
       The Interrupt Line register communicates interrupt line routing
       information. The register is read/write and must be implemented by any
       Function that uses an interrupt pin (see following description). Values
       in this register are programmed by system software and are system
       architecture specific. The Function itself does not use this value;
       rather the value in this register is used by device drivers and
       operating systems.
