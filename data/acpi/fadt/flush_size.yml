  long_name: "FLUSH_SIZE"
  purpose: |
       "
       If WBINVD=0, the value of this field is the number of flush strides that
       need to be read (using cacheable addresses) to completely flush dirty
       lines from any processor’s memory caches. Notice that the value in
       FLUSH_STRIDE is typically the smallest cache line width on any of the
       processor’s caches (for more information, see the FLUSH_STRIDE field
       definition). If the system does not support a method for flushing the
       processor’s caches, then FLUSH_SIZE and WBINVD are set to zero. Notice
       that this method of flushing the processor caches has limitations, and
       WBINVD=1 is the preferred way to flush the processors caches. This value
       is typically at least 2 times the cache size. The maximum allowed value
       for FLUSH_SIZE multiplied by FLUSH_STRIDE is 2 MB for a typical maximum
       supported cache size of 1 MB. Larger cache sizes are supported using
       WBINVD=1.  This value is ignored if WBINVD=1.  This field is maintained
       for ACPI 1.0 processor compatibility on existing systems. Processors in
       new ACPI-compatible systems are required to support the WBINVD function
       and indicate this to OSPM by setting the WBINVD field = 1.
