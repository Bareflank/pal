       Extended address of the General-Purpose Event 1 Register Block,
       represented in Generic Address Structure format. See Section 4.8.4.1
       “General-Purpose Event Register Blocks,” for a hardware description of
       this register block. This is an optional field; if this register block
       is not supported, this field contains zero. If this field contains a
       nonzero value which can be used by the OSPM, then the GPE1_BLK field
       must be ignored by the OSPM.
