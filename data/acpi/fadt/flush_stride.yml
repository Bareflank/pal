       If WBINVD=0, the value of this field is the cache line width, in bytes,
       of the processor’s memory caches. This value is typically the smallest
       cache line width on any of the processor’s caches. For more information,
       see the description of the FLUSH_SIZE field.  This value is ignored if
       WBINVD=1.  This field is maintained for ACPI 1.0 processor compatibility
       on existing systems. Processors in new ACPI-compatible systems are
       required to support the WBINVD function and indicate this to OSPM by
       setting the WBINVD field = 1.
