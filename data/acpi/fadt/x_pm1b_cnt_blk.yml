       Extended address of the PM1b Control Register Block, represented in
       Generic Address Structure format. See Section 4.8.3.2, “PM1 Control
       Grouping,” for a hardware description layout of this register block.
       This field is optional; if this register block is not supported, this
       field contains zero. If this field contains a nonzero value which can be
       used by the OSPM, then the PM1b_CNT_BLK field must be ignored by the
       OSPM.
