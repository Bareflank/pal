       "
       The RTC CMOS RAM index to the month of year alarm value. If this field
       contains a zero, then the RTC month of the year alarm feature is not
       supported. If this field has a non-zero value, then this field contains
       an index into RTC RAM space that OSPM can use to program the month of
       the year alarm. If this feature is supported, then the DAY_ALRM feature
       must be supported also.
