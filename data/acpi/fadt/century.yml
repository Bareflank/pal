       The RTC CMOS RAM index to the century of data value (hundred and
       thousand year decimals). If this field contains a zero, then the RTC
       centenary feature is not supported. If this field has a non-zero value,
       then this field contains an index into RTC RAM space that OSPM can use
       to program the centenary field.
