  purpose: |
       "
       The bit width of the processor’s duty cycle setting value in the P_CNT
       register. Each processor’s duty cycle setting allows the software to
       select a nominal processor frequency below its absolute frequency as
       defined by: THTL_EN = 1 BF * DC/(2DUTY_WIDTH) Where: BF–Base frequency
       DC–Duty cycle setting When THTL_EN is 0, the processor runs at its
       absolute BF. A DUTY_WIDTH value of 0 indicates that processor duty cycle
       is not supported and the processor continuously runs at its base
       frequency.
