       "
       Physical memory address of the FACS, where OSPM and Firmware exchange
       control information. See Section 5.2.6, “Root System Description Table,”
       for a description of the FACS. If the X_FIRMWARE_CTRL field contains a
       non zero value which can be used by the OSPM, then this field must be
       ignored by the OSPM. If the HARDWARE_REDUCED_ACPI flag is set, and both
       this field and the X_FIRMWARE_CTRL field are zero, there is no FACS
       available.
