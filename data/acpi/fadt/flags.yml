                  Processor properly implements a functional equivalent to the
                  WBINVD IA-32 instruction.  If set, signifies that the WBINVD
                  instruction correctly flushes the processor caches, maintains
                  memory coherency, and upon completion of the instruction, all
                  caches for the current processor contain no cached data other
                  than what OSPM references and allows to be cached. If this
                  flag is not set, the ACPI OS is responsible for disabling all
                  ACPI features that need this function. This field is

                  not guarantee the caches are invalidated. This provides the

                  A value of one indicates that OSPM should use a platform
                  provided timer to drive any monotonically non-decreasing
                  counters, such as OSPM performance counter services. Which
                  particular platform timer will be used is OSPM specific,
                  however, it is recommended that the timer used is based on
                  the following algorithm: If the HPET is exposed to OSPM, OSPM
                  should use the HPET. Otherwise, OSPM will use the ACPI power
                  management timer. A value of one indicates that the platform
                  is known to have a correctly implemented ACPI power
                  management timer.  A platform may choose to set this flag if
                  a internal processor clock (or clocks in a multi-processor
                  configuration) cannot provide consistent monotonically
                  non-decreasing counters.  Note:
                  If a value of zero is present, OSPM may arbitrarily choose to
                  use an internal processor clock or a platform timer clock for
                  these operations. That is, a zero does not imply that OSPM
                  will necessarily use the internal processor clock to generate
                  a monotonically non-decreasing counter to the system.
