  purpose: |
       "
       The value to write to SMI_CMD to re-enable SMI ownership of the ACPI
       hardware registers. This can only be done when ownership was originally
       acquired from SMI by OSPM using ACPI_ENABLE. An OS can hand ownership
       back to SMI by relinquishing use to the ACPI hardware registers, masking
       off all SCI interrupts, clearing the SCI_EN bit and then writing
       ACPI_DISABLE to the SMI_CMD port from the boot processor. This field is
       reserved and must be zero on systems that do not support Legacy Mode.
