       "
       Extended physical address of the FACS. If this field contains a nonzero
       value which can be used by the OSPM, then the FIRMWARE_CTRL field must
       be ignored by the OSPM. If the HARDWARE_REDUCED_ACPI flag is set, and
       both this field and the FIRMWARE_CTRL field are zero, there is no FACS
       available.
