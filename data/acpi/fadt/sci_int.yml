       "
       System vector the SCI interrupt is wired to in 8259 mode. On systems
       that do not contain the 8259, this field contains the Global System
       interrupt number of the SCI interrupt. OSPM is required to treat the
       ACPI SCI interrupt as a sharable, level, active low interrupt.
