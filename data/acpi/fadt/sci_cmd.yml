       "
       System port address of the SMI Command Port. During ACPI OS
       initialization, OSPM can determine that the ACPI hardware registers are
       owned by SMI (by way of the SCI_EN bit), in which case the ACPI OS
       issues the ACPI_ENABLE command to the SMI_CMD port. The SCI_EN bit
       effectively tracks the ownership of the ACPI hardware registers. OSPM
       issues commands to the SMI_CMD port synchronously from the boot
       processor. This field is reserved and must be zero on system that does
       not support System Management mode.
