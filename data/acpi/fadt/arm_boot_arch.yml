       ARM Boot Architecture Flags.

       These flags are used by an OS at boot time (before the OS is capable of
       providing an operating environment suitable for parsing the ACPI
       namespace) to determine the code paths to take during boot. For the PSCI
       flags, specifically, the flags describe if the platform is compliant
       with the PSCI specification.
       The PSCI specification is found at Links to ACPI-Related Document
       (http://uefi.org/acpi) under the heading PSCI Specification.  The ARM
       Architecture boot flags are described in Table 5-36
