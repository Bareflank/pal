       "
       The RTC CMOS RAM index to the day-of-month alarm value. If this field
       contains a zero, then the RTC day of the month alarm feature is not
       supported. If this field has a non-zero value, then this field contains
       an index into RTC RAM space that OSPM can use to program the day of the
       month alarm. See Section 4.8.2.4 “Real Time Clock Alarm,” for a
       description of how the hardware works.
