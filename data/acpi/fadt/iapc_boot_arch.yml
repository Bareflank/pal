                  If set, indicates that the motherboard supports user-visible
                  devices on the LPC or ISA bus. User-visible devices are
                  devices that have end-user accessible connectors (for
                  example, LPT port), or devices for which the OS must load a
                  device driver so that an end-user application can use a
                  device. If clear, the OS may assume there are no such devices
                  and that all devices in the system can be detected
                  exclusively via industry standard device enumeration
                  mechanisms (including the ACPI namespace).

                  as an 8042 or equivalent micro-controller.

                  check on this system. If clear, indicates to OSPM that it is
                  safe to probe the VGA hardware.
