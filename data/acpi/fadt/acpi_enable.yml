       "
       The value to write to SMI_CMD to disable SMI ownership of the ACPI
       hardware registers. The last action SMI does to relinquish ownership is
       to set the SCI_EN bit. During the OS initialization process, OSPM will
       synchronously wait for the transfer of SMI ownership to complete, so the
       ACPI system releases SMI ownership as quickly as possible. This field is
       reserved and must be zero on systems that do not support Legacy Mode.
