       Extended address of the PM2 Control Register Block, represented in
       Generic Address Structure format. See Section 4.8.3.4 “PM2 Control
       (PM2_CNT),” for a hardware description layout of this register block.
       This field is optional; if this register block is not supported, this
       field contains zero. If this field contains a nonzero value which can be
       used by the OSPM, then the PM2_CNT_BLK field must be ignored by the
       OSPM.
