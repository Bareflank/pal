  long_name: "Hypervisor Vendor Identity"
  purpose: |
       "
       64-bit identifier of hypervisor vendor. All bytes in this field are
       considered part of the vendor identity.  These identifiers are defined
       independently by the vendors themselves, usually following the name of
       the hypervisor product.  Version information should NOT be included in
       this field - this shall simply denote the vendor's name or identifier.
       Version information can be communicated through a supplemental
       vendor-specific hypervisor API.  Firmware implementers would place zero
       bytes into this field, denoting that no hypervisor is present in the
       actual firmware.
