  purpose: |
       "
       This field contains the Global Lock used to synchronize access to shared
       hardware resources between the OSPM environment and an external
       controller environment (for example, the SMI environment). This lock is
       owned exclusively by either OSPM or the firmware at any one time. When
       ownership of the lock is attempted, it might be busy, in which case the
       requesting environment exits and waits for the signal that the lock has
       been released. For example, the Global Lock can be used to protect an
       embedded controller interface such that only OSPM or the firmware will
       access the embedded controller interface at any one time. See Section
       5.2.10.1, “Global Lock,” for more information on acquiring and releasing
       the Global Lock.
