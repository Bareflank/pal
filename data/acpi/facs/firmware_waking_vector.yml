       This field is superseded by the X_Firmware_Waking_Vector field.  The
       32-bit address field where OSPM puts its waking vector. Before
       transitioning the system into a global sleeping state, OSPM fills in
       this field with the physical memory address of an OS-specific wake
       function. During POST, the platform firmware first checks if the value
       of the X_Firmware_Waking_Vector field is non-zero and if so transfers
       control to OSPM as outlined in the X_Firmware_Waking_vector field
       description below. If the X_Firmware_Waking_Vector field is zero then
       the platform firmware checks the value of this field and if it is
       non-zero, transfers control to the specified address.  On PCs, the wake
       function address is in memory below 1 MB and the control is transferred
       while in real mode. OSPM’s wake function restores the processors’
       context.  For IA-PC platforms, the following example shows the
       relationship between the physical address in the Firmware Waking Vector
       and the real mode address the BIOS jumps to. If, for example, the
       physical address is 0x12345, then the BIOS must jump to real mode
       address 0x1234:0x0005. In general this relationship is Real-mode address
       = Physical address>>4 : Physical address and 0x000F Notice that on IA-PC
       platforms, A20 must be enabled when the BIOS jumps to the real mode
       address derived from the physical address stored in the Firmware Waking
       Vector.
