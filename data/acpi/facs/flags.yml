                  restore the memory state in order to use the S4 state.

                  Indicates that the platform firmware supports a 64 bit
                  execution environment for the waking vector. When set and the
                  OSPM additionally set 64BIT_WAKE_F, the platform firmware
                  will create a 64 bit execution environment before
                  transferring control to the X_Firmware_Waking_Vector.
