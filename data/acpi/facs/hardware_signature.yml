       "
       The value of the system's 'hardware signature' at last boot. This value
       is calculated by the platform boot firmware on a best effort basis to
       indicate the base hardware configuration of the system such that
       different base hardware configurations can have different hardware
       signature values. Although memory described using or EfiPersistentMemory
       (Section 15) iis not saved/restored by OS during S4, any change to
       persistent memory that impacts any OS visible firmware interfaces must
       change hardware signature. Any change to the data in Persistent Memory
       itself should not be included in computing the hardware signature.  OSPM
       uses this information in waking from an S4 state, by comparing the
       current hardware signature to the signature values saved in the
       non-volatile sleep image. If the values are not the same, OSPM assumes
       that the saved non-volatile image is from a different hardware
       configuration and cannot be restored.
