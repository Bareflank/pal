       64-bit physical address of OSPM’s Waking Vector.  Before transitioning
       the system into a global sleeping state, OSPM fills in this field and
       the OSPM Flags field to describe the waking vector. OSPM populates this
       field with the physical memory address of an OS-specific wake function.
       During POST, the platform firmware checks if the value of this field is
       non-zero and if so transfers control to OSPM by jumping to this address
       after creating the appropriate execution environment, which must be
       configured as follows: For 64-bit ItaniumTM Processor Family (IPF)
       -based platforms: Interrupts must be disabled The processor must have
       psr.i set to 0. See the Intel® ItaniumTM Architecture Software
       Developer’s Manual for more information.  Memory address translation
       must be disabled The processor must have psr.it, psr.dt, and psr.rt set
       to 0. See the Intel® ItaniumTM Architecture Software Developer’s Manual
       for more information.  For IA 32 and x64 platforms, platform firmware is
       required to support a 32 bit execution environment.  Platform firmware
       can additionally support a 64 bit execution environment. If platform
       firmware supports a 64 bit execution environment, firmware inspects the
       OSPM Flags during POST. If the 64BIT_WAKE_F flag is set, the platform
       firmware creates a 64 bit execution environment. Otherwise, the platform
       firmware creates a 32 bit execution environment.  For 64 bit execution
       environment: Interrupts must be disabled EFLAGS.IF set to 0 Long mode
       enabled Paging mode is enabled and physical memory for waking vector is
       identity mapped (virtual address equals physical address) Waking vector
       must be contained within one physical page Selectors are set to be flat
       and are otherwise not used For 32 bit execution environment: Interrupts
       must be disabled EFLAGS.IF set to 0 Memory address translation / paging
       must be disabled 4 GB flat address space for all segment registers
