       OSPM enabled firmware control structure flags. Platform firmware must
       initialize this field to zero. See Table 5-39 for a description of the
       OSPM control structure feature flags.

                  OSPM sets this bit to indicate to platform firmware that the
                  X_Firmware_Waking_Vector requires a 64 bit execution
                  environment.  This flag can only be set if platform firmware
                  sets 64BIT_WAKE_SUPPORTED_F in the FACS flags field.  This
                  bit field has no affect on ItaniumTM Processor Family (IPF) -
                  based platforms, which require a 64 bit execution
                  environment.
