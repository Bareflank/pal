                  Pending Break Enable. The processor supports the use of the
                  FERR#/PBE# pin when the processor is in the stop-clock state
                  (STPCLK# is asserted) to signal the processor that an
                  interrupt is pending and that the processor should return to
                  normal operation to handle the interrupt. Bit 10 (PBE enable)
                  in the IA32_MISC_ENABLE MSR enables this capability.
