      "
      When CPUID executes with EAX set to 01H, additional information is
      returned to the EBX register:
          • Brand index (low byte of EBX) — this
            number provides an entry into a brand string table that contains
            brand strings for IA-32 processors. More information about this
            field is provided later in this section.
          • CLFLUSH instruction cache line size (second byte of EBX) — this
            number indicates the size of the cache line flushed by the CLFLUSH
            and CLFLUSHOPT instructions in 8-byte increments. This field was
            introduced in the Pentium 4 processor.
          • Local APIC ID (high byte of EBX) — this number is the 8-bit ID that
            is assigned to the local APIC on the processor during power up.
