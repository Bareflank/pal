      When CPUID executes with EAX set to 01H, version information is returned
      in EAX (see Figure 3-6). For example: model, family, and processor type
      for the Intel Xeon processor 5100 series is as follows:
          • Model — 1111B
          • Family — 0101B
          • Processor Type — 00B
