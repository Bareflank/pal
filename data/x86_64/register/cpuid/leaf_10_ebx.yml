      "
      When CPUID executes with EAX set to 10H and ECX = 0, the processor
      returns information about the bit-vector representation of QoS
      Enforcement resource types that are supported in the processor. Each bit,
      starting from bit 1, corresponds to a specific resource type if the bit
      is set. The bit position corresponds to the sub-leaf index (or ResID)
      that software must use to query QoS enforcement capability available for
      that type. See Table 3-8.  When CPUID executes with EAX set to 10H and
      ECX = n (n >= 1, and is a valid ResID), the processor returns information
      about available classes of service and range of QoS mask MSRs that
      software can use to configure each class of services using capability bit
      masks in the QoS Mask registers, IA32_resourceType_Mask_n
