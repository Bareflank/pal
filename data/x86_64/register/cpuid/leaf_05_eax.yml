      When CPUID executes with EAX set to 05H, the processor returns
      information about features available to MONITOR/MWAIT instructions. The
      MONITOR instruction is used for address-range monitoring in conjunction
      with MWAIT instruction. The MWAIT instruction optionally provides
      additional extensions for advanced power management. See Table 3-8.
