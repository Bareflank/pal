      Returns V2 Extended Topology Information

  purpose: |
      "
      When CPUID executes with EAX set to 1FH, the processor returns
      information about extended topology enumeration data. Software must
      detect the presence of CPUID leaf 1FH by verifying (a) the highest leaf
      index supported by CPUID is >= 1FH, and (b) CPUID.1FH:EBX[15:0] reports a
      non-zero value. See Table 3-8.
