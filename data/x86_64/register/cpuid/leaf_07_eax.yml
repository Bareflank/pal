      When CPUID executes with EAX set to 07H and ECX = 0, the processor
      returns information about the maximum input value for sub-leaves that
      contain extended feature flags. See Table 3-8.  When CPUID executes with
      EAX set to 07H and the input value of ECX is invalid (see leaf 07H entry
      in Table 3-8), the processor returns 0 in EAX/EBX/ECX/EDX. In subleaf 0,
      EAX returns the maximum input value of the highest leaf 7 sub-leaf, and
      EBX, ECX & EDX contain information of extended feature flags.
