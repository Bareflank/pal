      "
      When CPUID executes with EAX set to 04H and ECX contains an index value,
      the processor returns encoded data that describe a set of deterministic
      cache parameters (for the cache level associated with the input in ECX).
      Valid index values start from 0.
      
      Software can enumerate the deterministic cache parameters for each level
      of the cache hierarchy starting with an index value of 0, until the
      parameters report the value associated with the cache type field is 0.
      The architecturally defined fields reported by deterministic cache
      parameters are documented in Table 3-8.

      This Cache Size in Bytes
          = (Ways + 1) * (Partitions + 1) * (Line_Size + 1) * (Sets + 1)
          = (EBX[31:22] + 1) * (EBX[21:12] + 1) * (EBX[11:0] + 1) * (ECX + 1)
      
      The CPUID leaf 04H also reports data that can be used to derive the
      topology of processor cores in a physical package.  This information is
      constant for all valid index values. Software can query the raw data
      reported by executing CPUID with EAX=04H and ECX=0 and use it as part of
      the topology enumeration algorithm described in Chapter 8,
      “Multiple-Processor Management,” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures
      Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A.
