      "
      When CPUID executes with EAX set to 0DH and ECX = 0, the processor
      returns information about the bit-vector representation of all processor
      state extensions that are supported in the processor and storage size
      requirements of the XSAVE/XRSTOR area. See Table 3-8.  When CPUID
      executes with EAX set to 0DH and ECX = n (n > 1, and is a valid sub-leaf
      index), the processor returns information about the size and offset of
      each processor extended state save area within the XSAVE/XRSTOR area.
      See Table 3-8. Software can use the forward-extendable technique depicted
      below to query the valid sub-leaves and obtain size and offset
      information for each processor extended state save area: For i = 2 to 62
      // sub-leaf 1 is reserved IF (CPUID.(EAX=0DH, ECX=0):VECTOR[i] = 1 ) //
      VECTOR is the 64-bit value of EDX:EAX Execute CPUID.(EAX=0DH, ECX = i) to
      examine size and offset for sub-leaf i; FI;
