      When CPUID executes with EAX set to 12H and ECX = 0H, the processor
      returns information about Intel SGX capabilities. See Table 3-8.  When
      CPUID executes with EAX set to 12H and ECX = 1H, the processor returns
      information about Intel SGX attributes. See Table 3-8.  When CPUID
      executes with EAX set to 12H and ECX = n (n > 1), the processor returns
      information about Intel SGX Enclave Page Cache. See Table 3-8.
