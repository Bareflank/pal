  long_name: "Architectural Performance Monitoring Leaf"
  purpose: |
      "
      When CPUID executes with EAX set to 0AH, the processor returns
      information about support for architectural performance monitoring
      capabilities. Architectural performance monitoring is supported if the
      version ID (see Table 3-8) is greater than Pn 0. See Table 3-8.  For each
      version of architectural performance monitoring capability, software must
      enumerate this leaf to discover the programming facilities and the
      architectural performance events available in the processor. The details
      are described in Chapter 23, “Introduction to Virtual-Machine
      Extensions,” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software
      Developer’s Manual, Volume 3C.
