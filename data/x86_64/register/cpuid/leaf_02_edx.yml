  long_name: "Basic CPUID Information"
  purpose: |
      "
      When CPUID executes with EAX set to 02H, the processor returns
      information about the processor’s internal TLBs, cache and prefetch hardware
      in the EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX registers. The information is reported in
      encoded form and fall into the following categories:
          • The least-significant byte in register EAX (register AL) will
            always return 01H. Software should ignore this value and not
            interpret it as an informational descriptor.
          • The most significant bit (bit 31) of each register indicates
            whether the register contains valid information (set to 0) or is
            reserved (set to 1).
          • If a register contains valid information, the information is
            contained in 1 byte descriptors. There are four types of encoding
            values for the byte descriptor, the encoding type is noted in the
            second column of Table 3-12. Table 3-12 lists the encoding of these
            descriptors. Note that the order of descriptors in the EAX, EBX,
            ECX, and EDX registers is not defined; that is, specific bytes are
            not designated to contain descriptors for specific cache, prefetch,
            or TLB types. The descriptors may appear in any order. Note also a
            processor may report a general descriptor type (FFH) and not report
            any byte descriptor of “cache type” via CPUID leaf 2.
