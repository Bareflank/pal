      The exception bitmap is a 32-bit field that contains one bit for each
      exception. When an exception occurs, its vector is used to select a bit
      in this field. If the bit is 1, the exception causes a VM exit. If the
      bit is 0, the exception is delivered normally through the IDT, using the
      descriptor corresponding to the exceptionâ€™s vector.  Whether a page fault
      (exception with vector 14) causes a VM exit is determined by bit 14 in
      the exception bitmap as well as the error code produced by the page fault
      and two 32-bit fields in the VMCS (the page-fault error-code mask and
      page-fault error-code match). See Section 25.2 for details.
