      This field contains the physical address of the VM-entry MSR-load area.
      The area is a table of entries, 16 bytes per entry, where the number of
      entries is given by the VM-entry MSR-load count. The format of entries
      is described in Table 24-12. If the VM-entry MSR-load count is not zero,
      the address must be 16-byte aligned.
