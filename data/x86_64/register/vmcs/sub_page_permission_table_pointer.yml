      If the sub-page write-permission feature of EPT is enabled, EPT write
      permissions may be determined at a 128- byte granularity (see Section
      28.2.4). These permissions are determined using a hierarchy of
      sub-page-permission structures in memory.  The root of this hierarchy is
      referenced by a VM-execution control field called the
      sub-page-permission-table pointer (SPPTP). The SPPTP contains the address
      of the base of the root SPP table (see Section 28.2.4.2). The format of
      this field is shown in Table 24-8.

                  The SPPTP exists only on processors that support the
                  1-setting of the “sub-page write permissions for EPT”
                  VMexecution control. N is the processor’s physical-address
                  width. Software can determine this width by executing CPUID
                  with 80000008H in EAX. The physical-address width is returned
                  in bits 7:0 of EAX.
