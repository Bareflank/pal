  purpose: |
      "
      This field identifies the logical processor’s activity state. When a
      logical processor is executing instructions normally, it is in the
      active state. Execution of certain instructions and the occurrence of
      certain events may cause a logical processor to transition to an
      inactive state in which it ceases to execute instructions.  The
      following activity states are defined:1 — 0: Active. The logical
      processor is executing instructions normally.  — 1: HLT. The logical
      processor is inactive because it executed the HLT instruction.  — 2:
          Shutdown. The logical processor is inactive because it incurred a
      triple fault2 or some other serious error.  — 3: Wait-for-SIPI. The
      logical processor is inactive because it is waiting for a startup-IPI
      (SIPI).  Future processors may include support for other activity states.
      Software should read the VMX capability MSR IA32_VMX_MISC (see Appendix
      A.6) to determine what activity states are supported.
