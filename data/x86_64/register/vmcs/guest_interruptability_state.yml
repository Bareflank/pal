      The IA-32 architecture includes features that permit certain events to be
      blocked for a period of time. This field contains information about such
      blocking. Details and the format of this field are given in Table 24-3.

                  blocks maskable interrupts on the instruction boundary
                  following its execution.1 Setting this bit indicates that

                  See Section 6.8.3, “Masking Exceptions and Interrupts When
                  Switching Stacks,” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures
                  Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A.  Execution of a MOV
                  to SS or a POP to SS blocks or suppresses certain debug
                  exceptions as well as interrupts (maskable and nonmaskable)
                  on the instruction boundary following its execution.  Setting
                  this bit indicates that this blocking is in effect.2 This
                  document uses the term “blocking by MOV SS,” but it applies
                  equally to POP SS.

                  See Section 34.2, “System Management Interrupt (SMI).”
                  System-management interrupts (SMIs) are disabled while the
                  processor is in system-management mode (SMM). Setting this
                  bit indicates that blocking of SMIs is in effect.

                  See Section 6.7.1, “Handling Multiple NMIs,” in the Intel® 64
                  and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume
                  3A and Section 34.8, “NMI Handling While in SMM.” Delivery of
                  a non-maskable interrupt (NMI) or a system-management
                  interrupt (SMI) blocks subsequent NMIs until the next
                  execution of IRET. See Section 25.3 for how this behavior of
                  IRET may change in VMX non-root operation. Setting this bit
                  indicates that blocking of NMIs is in effect. Clearing this
                  bit does not imply that NMIs are not (temporarily) blocked
                  for other reasons.  If the “virtual NMIs” VM-execution
                  control (see Section 24.6.1) is 1, this bit does not control
                  the blocking of NMIs. Instead, it refers to “virtual-NMI
                  blocking” (the fact that guest software is not ready for an
                  NMI).

                  Set to 1 if the VM exit occurred while the logical processor
                  was in enclave mode.  Such VM exits includes those caused by

                  interrupts, INIT signals, and exceptions occurring in enclave
                  mode as well as exceptions encountered during the delivery of
                  such events incident to enclave mode.  A VM exit that is
                  incident to delivery of an event injected by VM entry leaves
                  this bit unmodified.
