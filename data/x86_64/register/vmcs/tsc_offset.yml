      "
      The VM-execution control fields include a 64-bit TSC-offset field. If the
      “RDTSC exiting” control is 0 and the “use TSC offsetting” control is 1,
      this field controls executions of the RDTSC and RDTSCP instructions. It
      also controls executions of the RDMSR instruction that read from the
      IA32_TIME_STAMP_COUNTER MSR. For all of these, the value of the TSC
      offset is added to the value of the time-stamp counter, and the sum is
      returned to guest software in EDX:EAX.
