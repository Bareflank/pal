                  If such a VM exit occurs and this control is 1, the logical
                  processor acknowledges the interrupt controller, acquiring
                  the interrupt’s vector. The vector is stored in the VM-exit
                  interruption-information field, which is marked valid.  • If

                  not acknowledged and the VM-exit interruption-information
