      On processors that support the 1-setting of the “enable XSAVES/XRSTORS”
      VM-execution control, the VM-execution control fields include a 64-bit
      XSS-exiting bitmap. If the “enable XSAVES/XRSTORS” VM-execution control
      is 1, executions of XSAVES and XRSTORS may consult this bitmap (see
      Section 25.1.3 and Section 25.3).
