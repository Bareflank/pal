                  Otherwise, they are delivered normally through the guest
                  interrupt-descriptor table (IDT). If this control is 1, the
                  value of RFLAGS.IF does not affect interrupt blocking.

                  If this control is 1, non-maskable interrupts (NMIs) cause VM
                  exits. Otherwise, they are delivered normally using
                  descriptor 2 of the IDT. This control also determines
                  interactions between IRET and blocking by NMI (see Section
                  25.3).

                  If this control is 1, NMIs are never blocked and the
                  “blocking by NMI” bit (bit 3) in the interruptibility-state
                  field indicates “virtual-NMI blocking” (see Table 24-3). This
                  control also interacts with the “NMI-window exiting”
                  VM-execution control (see Section 24.6.2).
