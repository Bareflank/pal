      The VM-execution control fields include the 64-bit physical addresses of
      I/O bitmaps A and B (each of which are 4 KBytes in size). I/O bitmap A
      contains one bit for each I/O port in the range 0000H through 7FFFH; I/O
      bitmap B contains bits for ports in the range 8000H through FFFFH.  A
      logical processor uses these bitmaps if and only if the “use I/O bitmaps”
      control is 1. If the bitmaps are used, execution of an I/O instruction
      causes a VM exit if any bit in the I/O bitmaps corresponding to a port it
      accesses is 1. See Section 25.1.3 for details. If the bitmaps are used,
      their addresses must be 4-KByte aligned.
