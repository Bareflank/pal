  purpose: |
      "
      Processors that support the 1-setting of the “use TSC scaling” control
      also support a 64-bit TSC-multiplier field.  If this control is 1 (and
      the “RDTSC exiting” control is 0 and the “use TSC offsetting” control is
      1), this field also affects the executions of the RDTSC, RDTSCP, and
      RDMSR instructions identified above. Specifically, the contents of the
      time-stamp counter is first multiplied by the TSC multiplier before
      adding the TSC offset.
