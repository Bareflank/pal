      This instruction applies to the VMCS whose VMCS region resides at the
      physical address contained in the instruction operand. The instruction
      ensures that VMCS data for that VMCS (some of these data may be currently
      maintained on the processor) are copied to the VMCS region in memory. It
      also initializes parts of the VMCS region (for example, it sets the
      launch state of that VMCS to clear). See Chapter 24, “Virtual-Machine
      Control Structures”. The operand of this instruction is always 64 bits
      and is always in memory. If the operand is the current-VMCS pointer, then
      that pointer is made invalid (set to FFFFFFFF_FFFFFFFFH). Note that the
      VMCLEAR instruction might not explicitly write any VMCS data to memory;
      the data may be already resident in memory before the VMCLEAR is
      executed.
