      Searches the source operand (second operand) for the most significant set
      bit (1 bit). If a most significant 1 bit is found, its bit index is
      stored in the destination operand (first operand). The source operand can
      be a register or a memory location; the destination operand is a
      register. The bit index is an unsigned offset from bit 0 of the source
      operand. If the content source operand is 0, the content of the
      destination operand is undefined. In 64-bit mode, the instructionâ€™s
      default operation size is 32 bits. Using a REX prefix in the form of
      REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix
      in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bits. See the summary chart
      at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.
