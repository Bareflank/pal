      Performs a serializing operation on all load-from-memory instructions
      that were issued prior the LFENCE instruc- tion. Specifically, LFENCE
      does not execute until all prior instructions have completed locally, and
      no later instruc- tion begins execution until LFENCE completes. In
      particular, an instruction that loads from memory and that precedes an
      LFENCE receives data from memory prior to completion of the LFENCE. (An
      LFENCE that follows an instruction that stores to memory might complete
      before the data being stored have become globally visible.) Instructions
      following an LFENCE may be fetched from memory before the LFENCE, but
      they will not execute until the LFENCE completes. Weakly ordered memory
      types can be used to achieve higher processor performance through such
      techniques as out-of-order issue and speculative reads. The degree to
      which a consumer of data recognizes or knows that the data is weakly
      ordered varies among applications and may be unknown to the producer of
      this data. The LFENCE instruction provides a performance-efficient way of
      ensuring load ordering between routines that produce weakly- ordered
      results and routines that consume that data. Processors are free to
      fetch and cache data speculatively from regions of system memory that use
      the WB, WC, and WT memory types. This speculative fetching can occur at
      any time and is not tied to instruction execution. Thus, it is not
      ordered with respect to executions of the LFENCE instruction; data can be
      brought into the caches speculatively just before, during, or after the
      execution of an LFENCE instruction. This instructionâ€™s operation is the
      same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode. Specification of the
      instruction's opcode above indicates a ModR/M byte of E8. For this
      instruction, the processor ignores the r/m field of the ModR/M byte.
      Thus, LFENCE is encoded by any opcode of the form 0F AE Ex, where x is in
      the range 8-F.
