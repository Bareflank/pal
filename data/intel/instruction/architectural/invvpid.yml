  purpose: |
      "
      Invalidates mappings in the translation lookaside buffers (TLBs) and
      paging-structure caches based on virtual- processor identifier (VPID).
      (See Chapter 28, “VMX Support for Address Translation”.) Invalidation is
      based on the INVVPID type specified in the register operand and the
      INVVPID descriptor specified in the memory operand. Outside IA-32e mode,
      the register operand is always 32 bits, regardless of the value of CS.D;
      in 64-bit mode, the register operand has 64 bits (the instruction cannot
      be executed in compatibility mode). The INVVPID types supported by a
      logical processors are reported in the IA32_VMX_EPT_VPID_CAP MSR (see
      Appendix A, “VMX Capability Reporting Facility”). There are four INVVPID
      types currently defined: • Individual-address invalidation: If the
      INVVPID type is 0, the logical processor invalidates mappings for the
      linear address and VPID specified in the INVVPID descriptor. In some
      cases, it may invalidate mappings for other linear addresses (or other
      VPIDs) as well. • Single-context invalidation: If the INVVPID type is 1,
      the logical processor invalidates all mappings tagged with the VPID
      specified in the INVVPID descriptor. In some cases, it may invalidate
      mappings for other VPIDs as well. • All-contexts invalidation: If the
      INVVPID type is 2, the logical processor invalidates all mappings tagged
      with all VPIDs except VPID 0000H. In some cases, it may invalidate
      translations with VPID 0000H as well. • Single-context invalidation,
      retaining global translations: If the INVVPID type is 3, the logical
      processor invalidates all mappings tagged with the VPID specified in the
      INVVPID descriptor except global translations. In some cases, it may
      invalidate global translations (and mappings with other VPIDs) as well.
      See the “Caching Translation Information” section in Chapter 4 of the
      IA-32 Intel Architecture Software Developer’s Manual, Volumes 3A for
      information about global translations. If an unsupported INVVPID type is
      specified, the instruction fails. INVVPID invalidates all the specified
      mappings for the indicated VPID(s) regardless of the EPTP and PCID values
      with which those mappings may be associated.
