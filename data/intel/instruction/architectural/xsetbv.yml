      Writes the contents of registers EDX:EAX into the 64-bit extended control
      register (XCR) specified in the ECX register. (On processors that support
      the Intel 64 architecture, the high-order 32 bits of RCX are ignored.)
      The contents of the EDX register are copied to high-order 32 bits of the
      selected XCR and the contents of the EAX register are copied to low-order
      32 bits of the XCR. (On processors that support the Intel 64
      architecture, the high-order 32 bits of each of RAX and RDX are
      ignored.) Undefined or reserved bits in an XCR should be set to values
      previously read. This instruction must be executed at privilege level 0
      or in real-address mode; otherwise, a general protection exception #GP(0)
      is generated. Specifying a reserved or unimplemented XCR in ECX will also
      cause a general protection exception. The processor will also generate a
      general protection exception if software attempts to write to reserved
      bits in an XCR. Currently, only XCR0 is supported. Thus, all other
      values of ECX are reserved and will cause a #GP(0). Note that bit 0 of
      XCR0 (corresponding to x87 state) must be set to 1; the instruction will
      cause a #GP(0) if an attempt is made to clear this bit. In addition, the
      instruction causes a #GP(0) if an attempt is made to set XCR0[2] (AVX
      state) while clearing XCR0[1] (SSE state); it is necessary to set both
      bits to use AVX instructions; Section 13.3, “Enabling the XSAVE Feature
