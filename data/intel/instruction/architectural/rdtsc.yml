  long_name: "Read Time-Stamp Counter"
  purpose: |
      "
      Reads the current value of the processor’s time-stamp counter (a 64-bit
      MSR) into the EDX:EAX registers. The EDX register is loaded with the
      high-order 32 bits of the MSR and the EAX register is loaded with the
      low-order 32 bits. (On processors that support the Intel 64 architecture,
      the high-order 32 bits of each of RAX and RDX are cleared.) The processor
      monotonically increments the time-stamp counter MSR every clock cycle and
      resets it to 0 whenever the processor is reset. See “Time Stamp Counter”
      in Chapter 17 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software
      Developer’s Manual, Volume 3B, for specific details of the time stamp
      counter behavior. The time stamp disable (TSD) flag in register CR4
      restricts the use of the RDTSC instruction as follows. When the flag is
      clear, the RDTSC instruction can be executed at any privilege level; when
      the flag is set, the instruction can only be executed at privilege level
      0. The time-stamp counter can also be read with the RDMSR instruction,
      when executing at privilege level 0. The RDTSC instruction is not a
      serializing instruction. It does not necessarily wait until all previous
      instructions have been executed before reading the counter. Similarly,
      subsequent instructions may begin execution before the read operation is
      performed. The following items may guide software seeking to order
      executions of RDTSC: • If software requires RDTSC to be executed only
      after all previous instructions have executed and all previous loads are
      globally visible,1 it can execute LFENCE immediately before RDTSC. • If
      software requires RDTSC to be executed only after all previous
      instructions have executed and all previous loads and stores are globally
      visible, it can execute the sequence MFENCE;LFENCE immediately before
      RDTSC. • If software requires RDTSC to be executed prior to execution of
      any subsequent instruction (including any memory accesses), it can
      execute the sequence LFENCE immediately after RDTSC. This instruction
      was introduced by the Pentium processor. See “Changes to Instruction
      Behavior in VMX Non-Root Operation” in Chapter 25 of the Intel® 64 and
      IA-32 Archi- tectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3C, for more
      information about the behavior of this instruction in VMX non-root
      operation.
