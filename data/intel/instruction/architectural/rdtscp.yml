  long_name: "Read Time-Stamp Counter and Processor ID"
  purpose: |
      "
      Reads the current value of the processor’s time-stamp counter (a 64-bit
      MSR) into the EDX:EAX registers and also reads the value of the
      IA32_TSC_AUX MSR (address C0000103H) into the ECX register. The EDX
      register is loaded with the high-order 32 bits of the IA32_TSC MSR; the
      EAX register is loaded with the low-order 32 bits of the IA32_TSC MSR;
      and the ECX register is loaded with the low-order 32-bits of IA32_TSC_AUX
      MSR. On processors that support the Intel 64 architecture, the high-order
      32 bits of each of RAX, RDX, and RCX are cleared. The processor
      monotonically increments the time-stamp counter MSR every clock cycle and
      resets it to 0 whenever the processor is reset. See “Time Stamp Counter”
      in Chapter 17 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software
      Developer’s Manual, Volume 3B, for specific details of the time stamp
      counter behavior. The time stamp disable (TSD) flag in register CR4
      restricts the use of the RDTSCP instruction as follows. When the flag is
      clear, the RDTSCP instruction can be executed at any privilege level;
      when the flag is set, the instruction can only be executed at privilege
      level 0. The RDTSCP instruction is not a serializing instruction, but it
      does wait until all previous instructions have executed 1
      and all previous loads are globally visible.
      But it does not wait for previous stores to be globally visible, and
      subsequent instructions may begin execution before the read operation is
      performed. The following items may guide software seeking to order
      executions of RDTSCP: • If software requires RDTSCP to be executed only
      after all previous stores are globally visible, it can execute MFENCE
      immediately before RDTSCP. • If software requires RDTSCP to be executed
      prior to execution of any subsequent instruction (including any memory
      accesses), it can execute LFENCE immediately after RDTSCP. See “Changes
      to Instruction Behavior in VMX Non-Root Operation” in Chapter 25 of the
      Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume
      3C, for more information about the behavior of this instruction in VMX
      non-root operation.
