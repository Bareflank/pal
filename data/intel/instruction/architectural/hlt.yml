  purpose: |
      "
      Stops instruction execution and places the processor in a HALT state. An
      enabled interrupt (including NMI and SMI), a debug exception, the BINIT#
      signal, the INIT# signal, or the RESET# signal will resume execution. If
      an interrupt (including NMI) is used to resume execution after a HLT
      instruction, the saved instruction pointer (CS:EIP) points to the
      instruction following the HLT instruction. When a HLT instruction is
      executed on an Intel 64 or IA-32 processor supporting Intel
      Hyper-Threading Technology, only the logical processor that executes the
      instruction is halted. The other logical processors in the physical
      processor remain active, unless they are each individually halted by
      executing a HLT instruction. The HLT instruction is a privileged
      instruction. When the processor is running in protected or virtual-8086
      mode, the privilege level of a program or procedure must be 0 to execute
      the HLT instruction. This instructionâ€™s operation is the same in
      non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.
