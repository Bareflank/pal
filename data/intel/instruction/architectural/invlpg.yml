  purpose: |
      "
      Invalidates any translation lookaside buffer (TLB) entries specified with
      the source operand. The source operand is a memory address. The processor
      determines the page that contains that address and flushes all TLB
      entries for 1 The INVLPG instruction is a privileged instruction. When
      the processor is running in protected mode, the CPL must be 0 to execute
      this instruction. The INVLPG instruction normally flushes TLB entries
      only for the specified page; however, in some cases, it may flush more
      entries, even the entire TLB. The instruction is guaranteed to
      invalidates only TLB entries associated with the current PCID. (If PCIDs
      are disabled — CR4.PCIDE = 0 — the current PCID is 000H.) The instruction
      also invalidates any global TLB entries for the specified page,
      regardless of PCID. For more details on operations that flush the TLB,
      see “MOV—Move to/from Control Registers” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32
      Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2B and Section
      4.10.4.1, “Operations that Invalidate TLBs and Paging-Structure Caches,”
      in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual,
      Volume 3A. This instruction’s operation is the same in all non-64-bit
      modes. It also operates the same in 64-bit mode, except if the memory
      address is in non-canonical form. In this case, INVLPG is the same as a
      NOP.
