      Puts the logical processor in VMX operation with no current VMCS, blocks
      INIT signals, disables A20M, and clears any address-range monitoring
      established by the MONITOR instruction. The operand of this instruction
      is a 4KB-aligned physical address (the VMXON pointer) that references the
      VMXON region, which the logical processor may use to support VMX
      operation. This operand is always 64 bits and is always in memory.
