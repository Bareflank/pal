  long_name: "Invalidate Internal Caches"
  purpose: |
      "
      Invalidates (flushes) the processor’s internal caches and issues a
      special-function bus cycle that directs external caches to also flush
      themselves. Data held in internal caches is not written back to main
      memory. After executing this instruction, the processor does not wait
      for the external caches to complete their flushing oper- ation before
      proceeding with instruction execution. It is the responsibility of
      hardware to respond to the cache flush signal. The INVD instruction is a
      privileged instruction. When the processor is running in protected mode,
      the CPL of a program or procedure must be 0 to execute this instruction.
      The INVD instruction may be used when the cache is used as temporary
      memory and the cache contents need to be invalidated rather than written
      back to memory. When the cache is used as temporary memory, no external
      device should be actively writing data to main memory. Use this
      instruction with care. Data cached internally and not written back to
      main memory will be lost. Note that any data from an external device to
      main memory (for example, via a PCIWrite) can be temporarily stored in
      the caches; these data can be lost when an INVD instruction is executed.
      Unless there is a specific requirement or benefit to flushing caches
      without writing back modified cache lines (for example, temporary memory,
      testing, or fault recovery where cache coherency with main memory is not
      a concern), software should instead use the WBINVD instruction. This
      instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.
