- name: vmcall
  long_name: "Call to VM Monitor"
  purpose: |
      "
      This instruction allows guest software can make a call for service into
      an underlying VM monitor. The details of the programming interface for
      such calls are VMM-specific; this instruction does nothing more than
      cause a VM exit, registering the appropriate exit reason. Use of this
      instruction in VMX root operation invokes an SMM monitor (see Section
      34.15.2). This invocation will acti- vate the dual-monitor treatment of
      system-management interrupts (SMIs) and system-management mode (SMM) if
      it is not already active (see Section 34.15.6).
