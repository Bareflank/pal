  long_name: "Store Global Descriptor Table Register"
  purpose: |
      "
      Stores the content of the global descriptor table register (GDTR) in the
      destination operand. The destination operand specifies a memory location.
      In legacy or compatibility mode, the destination operand is a 6-byte
      memory location. If the operand-size attribute is 16 or 32 bits, the
      16-bit limit field of the register is stored in the low 2 bytes of the
      memory location and the 32- bit base address is stored in the high 4
      bytes. In 64-bit mode, the operand size is fixed at 8+2 bytes. The
      instruction stores an 8-byte base and a 2-byte limit. SGDT is useful
      only by operating-system software. However, it can be used in application
      programs without causing an exception to be generated if CR4.UMIP = 0.
      See “LGDT/LIDT—Load Global/Interrupt Descriptor Table Register” in
      Chapter 3, Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual,
      Volume 2A, for information on loading the GDTR and IDTR.
