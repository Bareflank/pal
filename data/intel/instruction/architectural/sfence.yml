- name: sfence
  long_name: "Store Fence"
  purpose: |
      "
      Orders processor execution relative to all memory stores prior to the
      SFENCE instruction. The processor ensures that every store prior to
      SFENCE is globally visible before any store after SFENCE becomes globally
      visible. The SFENCE instruction is ordered with respect to memory stores,
      other SFENCE instructions, MFENCE instructions, and any serializing
      instructions (such as the CPUID instruction). It is not ordered with
      respect to memory loads or the LFENCE instruction. Weakly ordered memory
      types can be used to achieve higher processor performance through such
      techniques as out-of-order issue, write-combining, and write-collapsing.
      The degree to which a consumer of data recognizes or knows that the data
      is weakly ordered varies among applications and may be unknown to the
      producer of this data. The SFENCE instruction provides a
      performance-efficient way of ensuring store ordering between routines
      that produce weakly-ordered results and routines that consume this data.
      This instructionâ€™s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit
      mode. Specification of the instruction's opcode above indicates a ModR/M
      byte of F8. For this instruction, the processor ignores the r/m field of
      the ModR/M byte. Thus, SFENCE is encoded by any opcode of the form 0F AE
      Fx, where x is in the range 8-F.
