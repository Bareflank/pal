  long_name: "Store Interrupt Descriptor Table Register"
  purpose: |
      "
      Stores the content the interrupt descriptor table register (IDTR) in the
      destination operand. The destination operand specifies a 6-byte memory
      location. In non-64-bit modes, the 16-bit limit field of the register is
      stored in the low 2 bytes of the memory location and the 32-bit base
      address is stored in the high 4 bytes. In 64-bit mode, the operand size
      fixed at 8+2 bytes. The instruction stores 8-byte base and 2-byte limit
      values. SIDT is only useful in operating-system software; however, it
      can be used in application programs without causing an exception to be
      generated if CR4.UMIP = 0. See “LGDT/LIDT—Load Global/Interrupt
      Descriptor Table Register” in Chapter 3, Intel® 64 and IA-32
      Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2A, for information on
      loading the GDTR and IDTR.
