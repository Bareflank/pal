      Marks the current-VMCS pointer valid and loads it with the physical
      address in the instruction operand. The instruction fails if its
      operand is not properly aligned, sets unsupported physical-address bits,
      or is equal to the VMXON pointer. In addition, the instruction fails if
      the 32 bits in memory referenced by the operand do not match the VMCS
      revision identifier supported by this processor. The operand of this
      instruction is always 64 bits and is always in memory.
