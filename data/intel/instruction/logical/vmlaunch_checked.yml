      Effects a VM entry managed by the current VMCS.  • VMLAUNCH fails if the
      launch state of current VMCS is not “clear”. If the instruction is
      successful, it sets the launch state to “launched.” • VMRESUME fails if
      the launch state of the current VMCS is not “launched.” If VM entry is
      attempted, the logical processor performs a series of consistency checks
      as detailed in Chapter 26, “VM Entries”. Failure to pass checks on the
      VMX controls or on the host-state area passes control to the instruction
      following the VMLAUNCH or VMRESUME instruction. If these pass but checks
      on the guest-state area fail, the logical processor loads state from the
      host-state area of the VMCS, passing control to the instruction
      referenced by the RIP field in the host-state area.  VM entry is not
      allowed when events are blocked by MOV SS or POP SS. Neither VMLAUNCH nor
      VMRESUME should be used immediately after either MOV to SS or POP to SS.
