      Processors that support the 1-setting of the “EPTP switching” VM-function
      control also support a 64-bit field called the EPTP-list address. This
      field contains the physical address of the 4-KByte EPTP list. The EPTP
      list comprises 512 8-Byte entries (each an EPTP value) and is used by the
      EPTP-switching VM function (see Section 25.5.5.3).
