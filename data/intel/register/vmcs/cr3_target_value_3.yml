      "
      The VM-execution control fields include a set of 4 CR3-target values and
      a CR3-target count. The CR3-target values each have 64 bits on processors
      that support Intel 64 architecture and 32 bits on processors that do not.
      The CR3-target count has 32 bits on all processors.  An execution of MOV
      to CR3 in VMX non-root operation does not cause a VM exit if its source
      operand matches one of these values. If the CR3-target count is n, only
      the first n CR3-target values are considered; if the CR3-target count is
      0, MOV to CR3 always causes a VM exit There are no limitations on the
      values that can be written for the CR3-target values. VM entry fails (see
      Section 26.2) if the CR3-target count is greater than 4.  Future
      processors may support a different number of CR3-target values. Software
      should read the VMX capability MSR IA32_VMX_MISC (see Appendix A.6) to
      determine the number of values supported.
