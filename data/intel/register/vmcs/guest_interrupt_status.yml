      This field is supported only on processors that support the 1-setting of
      the “virtual-interrupt delivery” VM-execution control. It characterizes
      part of the guest’s virtual-APIC state and does not correspond to any
      processor or APIC registers. It comprises two 8-bit subfields

                  This is the low byte of the guest interrupt status. The
                  processor treats this value as the vector of the highest
                  priority virtual interrupt that is requesting service. (The
                  value 0 implies that there is no such interrupt.)
