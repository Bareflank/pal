      "
      The VM-function controls constitute a 64-bit vector that governs use of
      the VMFUNC instruction in VMX non-root operation. This field is supported
      only on processors that support the 1-settings of both the “activate
      secondary controls” primary processor-based VM-execution control and the
      “enable VM functions” secondary processorbased VM-execution control.
      Table 24-9 lists the VM-function controls. See Section 25.5.5 for more
      details of how these controls affect processor behavior in VMX non-root
      operation.

                  value chosen from the EPTP list.  See Section 25.5.5.3.
