      VM-execution control fields include guest/host masks and read shadows for
      the CR0 and CR4 registers. These fields control executions of
      instructions that access those registers (including CLTS, LMSW, MOV CR,
      and SMSW).  They are 64 bits on processors that support Intel 64
      architecture and 32 bits on processors that do not.  In general, bits
      set to 1 in a guest/host mask correspond to bits “owned” by the host: •
      Guest attempts to set them (using CLTS, LMSW, or MOV to CR) to values
      differing from the corresponding bits in the corresponding read shadow
      cause VM exits.  • Guest reads (using MOV from CR or SMSW) return values
      for these bits from the corresponding read shadow.  Bits cleared to 0
      correspond to bits “owned” by the guest; guest attempts to modify them
      succeed and guest reads return values for these bits from the control
      register itself.  See Chapter 27 for details regarding how these fields
      affect VMX non-root operation.
