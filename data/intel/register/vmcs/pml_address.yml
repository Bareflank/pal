      The PML address is a 64-bit field. It is the 4-KByte aligned address of
      the page-modification log. The pagemodification log consists of 512
      64-bit entries. It is used for the page-modification logging feature.
      Details of the page-modification logging are given in Section 28.2.6.  If
      the “enable PML” VM-execution control is 1, VM entry ensures that the PML
      address is 4-KByte aligned. The PML address exists only on processors
      that support the 1-setting of the “enable PML” VM-execution control.
