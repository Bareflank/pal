      This field contains the physical address of the 4-KByte APIC-access page.
      If the “virtualize APIC accesses” VM-execution control is 1, access to
      this page may cause VM exits or be virtualized by the processor. See
      Section 29.4.  The APIC-access address exists only on processors that
      support the 1-setting of the “virtualize APIC accesses” VM-execution
      control.
