  purpose: |
      "
      Bits 3:0 of this field determine the threshold below which bits 7:4 of
      VTPR (see Section 29.1.1) cannot fall. If the “virtual-interrupt
      delivery” VM-execution control is 0, a VM exit occurs after an operation
      (e.g., an execution of MOV to CR8) that reduces the value of those bits
      below the TPR threshold.  See Section 29.1.2. The TPR threshold exists
      only on processors that support the 1-setting of the “use TPR shadow”
      VM-execution control.
