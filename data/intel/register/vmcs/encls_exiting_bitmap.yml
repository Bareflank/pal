      "
      The ENCLS-exiting bitmap is a 64-bit field. If the “enable ENCLS exiting”
      VM-execution control is 1, execution of ENCLS causes a VM exit if the bit
      in this field corresponding to the value of EAX is 1. If the bit is 0,
      the instruction executes normally. See Section 25.1.3 for more
      information.
