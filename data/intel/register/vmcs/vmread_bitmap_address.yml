      On processors that support the 1-setting of the “VMCS shadowing”
      VM-execution control, the VM-execution control fields include the 64-bit
      physical addresses of the VMREAD bitmap and the VMWRITE bitmap. Each
      bitmap is 4 KBytes in size and thus contains 32 KBits. The addresses are
      the VMREAD-bitmap address and the VMWRITEbitmap address.  If the “VMCS
      shadowing” VM-execution control is 1, executions of VMREAD and VMWRITE
      may consult these bitmaps (see Section 24.10 and Section 30.3).
