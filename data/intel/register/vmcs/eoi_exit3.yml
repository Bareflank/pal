      These fields are supported only on processors that support the 1- setting
      of the “virtual-interrupt delivery” VM-execution control. They are used
      to determine which virtualized writes to the APIC’s EOI register cause VM
      exits. EOI_EXIT3 contains bits for vectors from 192 (bit 0) to 255 (bit
      63).
