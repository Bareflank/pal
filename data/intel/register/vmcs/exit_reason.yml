                  exit (if bit 31 is clear) or of the VM-entry failure (if bit
                  31 is set). Appendix C enumerates the basic exit reasons.

                  Bit 27 is set to 1 if the VM exit occurred while the logical
                  processor was in enclave mode.  A VM exit also sets this bit
                  if it is incident to delivery of an event injected by VM
                  entry and the guest interruptibility-state field indicates
                  an enclave interrupt (bit 4 of the field is 1). See Section
                  27.2.1 for details.

                   Because some VM-entry failures load processor state from the
                   host-state area (see Section 26.8), software must be able to
                   distinguish such cases from true VM exits. Bit 31 is used
                   for that purpose.
