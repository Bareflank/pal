      These four (4) fields (PDPTE0, PDPTE1, PDPTE2, and PDPTE3) are supported
      only on processors that support the 1-setting of the “enable EPT”
      VMexecution control. They correspond to the PDPTEs referenced by CR3 when
      PAE paging is in use (see Section 4.4 in the Intel® 64 and IA-32
      Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A). They are used only
      if the “enable EPT” VM-execution control is 1.
