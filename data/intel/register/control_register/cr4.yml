                  Virtual-8086 Mode Extensions (bit 0 of CR4) — Enables
                  interrupt- and exception-handling extensions in virtual-8086
                  mode when set; disables the extensions when clear. Use of the
                  virtual mode extensions can improve the performance of
                  virtual-8086 applications by eliminating the overhead of
                  calling the virtual8086 monitor to handle interrupts and
                  exceptions that occur while executing an 8086 program and,
                  instead, redirecting the interrupts and exceptions back to
                  the 8086 program’s handlers. It also provides hardware
                  support for a virtual interrupt flag (VIF) to improve
                  reliability of running 8086 programs in multitasking and
                  multiple-processor environments

                  Protection-Key-Enable Bit (bit 22 of CR4) — Enables 4-level
                  paging to associate each linear address with a protection
                  key. The PKRU register specifies, for each protection key,
                  whether user-mode linear addresses with that protection key
                  can be read or written. This bit also enables access to the
                  PKRU register using the RDPKRU and WRPKRU instructions.
