      Provides read and write access to the Task Priority Register (TPR). It
      specifies the priority threshold value that operating systems use to
      control the priority class of external interrupts allowed to interrupt
      the processor. This register is available only in 64-bit mode. However,
      interrupt filtering continues to apply in compatibility mode

                  Task Priority Level (bit 3:0 of CR8) — This sets the
                  threshold value corresponding to the highestpriority
                  interrupt to be blocked. A value of 0 means all interrupts
                  are enabled. This field is available in 64- bit mode. A value
                  of 15 means all interrupts will be disabled.
