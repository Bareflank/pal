                  Protection Enable (bit 0 of CR0) — Enables protected mode
                  when set; enables real-address mode when clear. This flag
                  does not enable paging directly. It only enables
                  segment-level protection. To enable paging, both the PE and
                  PG flags must be set.

                  Monitor Coprocessor (bit 1 of CR0) — Controls the interaction
                  of the WAIT (or FWAIT) instruction with the TS flag (bit 3 of
                  CR0). If the MP flag is set, a WAIT instruction generates a
                  device-not-available exception (#NM) if the TS flag is also
                  set. If the MP flag is clear, the WAIT instruction ignores
                  the setting of the TS flag.  Table 9-3 shows the recommended
                  setting of this flag, depending on the IA-32 processor and
                  x87 FPU or math coprocessor present in the system.

                  an x87 FPU is present when clear. This flag also affects the
