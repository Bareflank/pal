      If CPUID.01H:ECX.XSAVE[bit 26] is 1, the processor supports one or more
      extended control registers (XCRs).  Currently, the only such register
      defined is XCR0. This register specifies the set of processor state
      components for which the operating system provides context management,
      e.g. x87 FPU state, SSE state, AVX state. The OS programs XCR0 to reflect
      the features for which it provides context management.
