      Contains the physical address of the base of the paging-structure
      hierarchy and two flags (PCD and PWT). Only the most-significant bits
      (less the lower 12 bits) of the base address are specified; the lower 12
      bits of the address are assumed to be 0. The first paging structure must
      thus be aligned to a page (4-KByte) boundary. The PCD and PWT flags
      control caching of that paging structure in the processor’s internal data
      caches (they do not control TLB caching of page-directory information)
