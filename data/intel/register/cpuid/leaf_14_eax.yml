      When CPUID executes with EAX set to 14H and ECX = 0H, the processor
      returns information about Intel Processor Trace extensions. See Table
      3-8.  When CPUID executes with EAX set to 14H and ECX = n (n > 0 and less
      than the number of non-zero bits in CPUID.(EAX=14H, ECX= 0H).EAX), the
      processor returns information about packet generation in Intel Processor
      Trace. See Table 3-8.
