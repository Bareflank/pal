      Returns Intel Resource Director Technology (Intel RDT) Monitoring
      Enumeration Information

      "
      When CPUID executes with EAX set to 0FH and ECX = 0, the processor
      returns information about the bit-vector representation of QoS monitoring
      resource types that are supported in the processor and maximum range of
      RMID values the processor can use to monitor of any supported resource
      types. Each bit, starting from bit 1, corresponds to a specific resource
      type if the bit is set. The bit position corresponds to the sub-leaf
      index (or ResID) that software must use to query QoS monitoring
      capability available for that type. See Table 3-8.  When CPUID executes
      with EAX set to 0FH and ECX = n (n >= 1, and is a valid ResID), the
      processor returns information software can use to program IA32_PQR_ASSOC,
      IA32_QM_EVTSEL MSRs before reading QoS data from the IA32_QM_CTR MSR
