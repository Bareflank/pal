      CPUID leaf 1FH is a preferred superset to leaf 0BH. Intel recommends
      first checking for the existence of Leaf 1FH before using leaf 0BH.  When
      CPUID executes with EAX set to 0BH, the processor returns information
      about extended topology enumeration data. Software must detect the
      presence of CPUID leaf 0BH by verifying (a) the highest leaf index
      supported by CPUID is >= 0BH, and (b) CPUID.0BH:EBX[15:0] reports a
      non-zero value. See Table 3-8.
