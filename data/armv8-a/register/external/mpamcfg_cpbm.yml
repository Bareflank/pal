  purpose: |
       "
       The MPAMCFG_CPBM register is a read-write register that configures the
       cache portions that a PARTID is allowed to allocate.  After setting
       MPAMCFG_PART_SEL with a PARTID, software (usually a hypervisor) writes
       to the MPAMCFG_CPBM register to configure which cache portions the
       PARTID is allowed to allocate.
