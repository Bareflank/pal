       "
       These registers track which preemption levels are active in the virtual
       CPU interface, and indicate the current active priority. Corresponding
       bits are set to 1 in this register when an interrupt is acknowledged,
       based on GICH_LR<n>.Priority, and the least significant bit set is
       cleared on EOI.
