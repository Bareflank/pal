       "
       The MPAMCFG_PART_SEL register is a 32-bit read-write register that
       selects a partition ID to configure.  After setting this register with a
       PARTID, software (usually a hypervisor) can perform a series of accesses
       to MPAMCFG registers to configure parameters for MPAM resource controls
       to use when requests have that PARTID.
