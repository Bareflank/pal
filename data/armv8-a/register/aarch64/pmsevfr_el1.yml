  purpose: |
       "
       Controls sample filtering by events. The overall filter is the logical
       AND of these filters. For example, if E[3] and E[5] are both set to 1,
       only samples that have both event 3 (Level 1 unified or data cache
       refill) and event 5 set (TLB walk) are recorded
