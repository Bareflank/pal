  purpose: |
      "
      Provides information about the processor and its capabilities through a
      number of different functions. Software should load the number of the
      CPUID function to execute into the EAX register before executing the
      CPUID instruction. The processor returns information in the EAX, EBX,
      ECX, and EDX registers; the contents and format of these registers depend
      on the function.  The architecture supports CPUID information about
      standard functions and extended functions. The standard functions have
      numbers in the 0000_xxxxh series (for example, standard function 1). To
      determine the largest standard function number that a processor supports,
      execute CPUID function 0.  The extended functions have numbers in the
      8000_xxxxh series (for example, extended function 8000_0001h). To
      determine the largest extended function number that a processor supports,
      execute CPUID extended function 8000_0000h. If the value returned in EAX
      is greater than 8000_0000h, the processor supports extended functions.
      Software operating at any privilege level can execute the CPUID
      instruction to collect this information. In 64-bit mode, this instruction
      works the same as in legacy mode except that it zero- extends 32-bit
      register results to 64 bits.  CPUID is a serializing instruction.
