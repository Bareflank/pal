        MSRC001_0113 [SMM TSeg Mask] (Core::X86::Msr::SMMMask)

        The ASeg address range is located at a fixed address from A0000h–BFFFFh. The TSeg range is located at a variable base
        (specified by Core::X86::Msr::SMMAddr[TSegBase[47:17]]) with a variable size (specified by
        Core::X86::Msr::SMMMask[TSegMask[47:17]]). These ranges provide a safe location for SMM code and data that is
        not readily accessible by non-SMM applications. The SMI handler can be located in one of these two ranges, or it can be
        located outside these ranges. These ranges must never overlap each other.

        • This register specifies how accesses to the ASeg and TSeg address ranges are controlled as follows:
        • If [A,T]Valid == 1, then:
          • If in SMM, then:
            • If [A, T]Close == 0, then the accesses are directed to DRAM with memory type as specified in [A, T]MTypeDram.
            • If [A, T]Close == 1, then instruction accesses are directed to DRAM with memory type as
              specified in [A, T]MTypeDram and data accesses are directed at MMIO space and with
              attributes based on [A, T]MTypeIoWc.
        
          • If not in SMM, then the accesses are directed at MMIO space with attributes based on
          [A,T]MTypeIoWc.
        
        See 2.1.3.3.1.1 [Determining Memory Type].
