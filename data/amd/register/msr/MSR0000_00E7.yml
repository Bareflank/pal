        MSR0000_00E7 [Max Performance Frequency Clock Count] (Core::X86::Msr::MPERF)

        MPERF: maximum core clocks counter. Read-write,Volatile. Reset: 0000_0000_0000_0000h. Incremented by 
        hardware at the P0 frequency while the core is in C0. This register does not increment when the core is in the 
        stop-grant state. In combination with Core::X86::Msr::APERF, this is used to determine the effective frequency 
        of the core. A read of this MSR in guest mode is affected by Core::X86::Msr::TscRateMsr. This field uses 
        software P-state numbering. See Core::X86::Msr::HWCR[EffFreqCntMwait], 2.1.2 [Effective Frequency]
