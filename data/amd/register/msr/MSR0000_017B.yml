        MSR0000_017B [Global Machine Check Exception Reporting Control] (Core::X86::Msr::MCG_CTL)

        This register controls enablement of the individual error reporting banks; see 3 [Machine Check Architecture]. When a 
        machine check register bank is not enabled in MCG_CTL, errors for that bank are not logged or reported, and actions 
        enabled through the MCA are not taken; each MCi_CTL register identifies which errors are still corrected when 
        MCG_CTL[i] is disabled.
