       MSRC001_1033 [IBS Execution Control] (Core::X86::Msr::IBS_OP_CTL)

        The IBS execution sampling engine is described as follows for IbsOpCntCtl == 1. If IbsOpCntCtl == 1n then references 
        to “periodic op counter" mean “periodic cycle counter". 
        • The periodic op counter is an internal 27-bit counter: 
        • It is set to IbsOpCurCnt[26:0] when IbsOpEn is changed from 0 to 1. 
        • It increments every dispatched op when IbsOpEn == 1 and IbsOpVal == 0. 
        • The periodic op counter is undefined when IbsOpEn == 0 or IbsOpVal == 1. 
        • When IbsOpCurCnt[26:0] is read then it returns the current value of the periodic micro-op counter 
        [26:0]. 
        • When the periodic micro-op counter reaches IbsOpMaxCnt: 
        • The next dispatched micro-op is tagged if IbsOpCntCtl == 1. A valid op in the next dispatched line is 
        tagged if IbsOpCntCtl == 0. See IbsOpCntCtl. 
        • The periodic micro-op counter [26:7]=0; [6:0] is randomized by hardware. 
        • The periodic micro-op counter is not modified when a tagged micro-op is flushed. 
        • When a tagged micro-op is retired: 
        • IbsOpVal is set to 1. 
        • Drivers can't assume that IbsOpCurCnt is 0 when IbsOpVal == 1. 
        • The status of the operation is written to the IBS execution registers (this register, Core::X86::Msr::IBS_OP_RIP, 
        Core::X86::Msr::IBS_OP_DATA, Core::X86::Msr::IBS_OP_DATA2, Core::X86::Msr::IBS_OP_DATA3, 
        Core::X86::Msr::IBS_DC_LINADDR and Core::X86::Msr::IBS_DC_PHYSADDR). 
        • An interrupt is generated as specified by Core::X86::Msr::IBS_CTL. The interrupt service routine associated 
        with this interrupt is responsible for saving the performance information stored in IBS execution registers.
