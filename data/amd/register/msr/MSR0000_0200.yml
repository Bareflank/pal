        MSR0000_020[0...E] [Variable-Size MTRRs Base] (Core::X86::Msr::MtrrVarBase)

        Each MTRR (Core::X86::Msr::MtrrVarBase, Core::X86::Msr::MtrrFix_64K through Core::X86::Msr::MtrrFix_4K_7, or 
        Core::X86::Msr::MTRRdefType) specifies a physical address range and a corresponding memory type (MemType) 
        associated with that range. Setting the memory type to an unsupported value results in a #GP. 
        The variable-size MTRRs come in pairs of base and mask registers (MSR0000_0200 and MSR0000_0201 are the first 
        pair, etc.). Variables MTRRs are enabled through Core::X86::Msr::MTRRdefType[MtrrDefTypeEn]. A core access--with
        address CPUAddr--is determined to be within the address range of a variable-size MTRR if the following equation is
        
        true: CPUAddr[47:12] & PhyMask[47:12] == PhyBase[47:12] & PhyMask[47:12].
        
        For example, if the variable MTRR spans 256 KB and starts at the 1 MB address the PhyBase would be set to
        0_0010_0000h and the PhyMask to F_FFFC_0000h (with zeros filling in for bits[11:0]). This results in a range from
        0_0010_0000h to 0_0013_FFFFh.
