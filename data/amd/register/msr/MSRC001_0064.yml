        MSRC001_006[4...B] [P-state [7:0]] (Core::X86::Msr::PStateDef)

        Each of these registers specify the frequency and voltage associated with each of the core P-states.
        The CpuVid field in these registers is required to be programmed to the same value in all cores of a processor, but are
        allowed to be different between processors in a multi-processor system. All other fields in these registers are required to
        be programmed to the same value in each core of the coherent fabric.
