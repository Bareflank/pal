        MSRC000_0104 [Time Stamp Counter Ratio] (Core::X86::Msr::TscRateMsr)
        
        Core::X86::Msr::TscRateMsr allows the hypervisor to control the guest's view of the Time Stamp Counter. It provides a
        multiplier that scales the value returned when Core::X86::Msr::TSC[TSC], Core::X86::Msr::MPERF[MPERF], and
        Core::X86::Msr::MPerfReadOnly[MPerfReadOnly] are read by a guest running under virtualization. This allows the
        hypervisor to provide a consistent TSC, MPERF, and MPerfReadOnly rate for a guest process when moving that process
        between cores that have a differing P0 rate. The TSC Ratio MSR does not affect the value read from the TSC, MPERF,
        and MPerfReadOnly MSRs when read when in host mode or when virtualization is not being used or when accessed by
        code executed in system management mode (SMM) unless the SMM code is executed within a guest container. The TSC
        Ratio value does not affect the rate of the underlying TSC, MPERF, and MPerfReadOnly counters, or the value that gets
        written to the TSC, MPERF, and MPerfReadOnly MSRs counters on a write by either the host or the guest. The TSC
        Ratio MSR contains a fixed-point number in 8.32 format, which is 8 bits of integer and 32 bits of fraction. This number
        is the ratio of the desired P0 frequency to the P0 frequency of the core. The reset value of the TSC Ratio MSR is 1.0,
        which results in a guest frequency matches the core P0 frequency.
