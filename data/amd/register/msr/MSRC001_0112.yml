        MSRC001_0112 [SMM TSeg Base Address] (Core::X86::Msr::SMMAddr) 
        
        See 2.1.8.1 [System Management Mode (SMM)] and 2.1.3.3.1 [Memory Access to the Physical Address Space]. See 
        Core::X86::Msr::SMMMask for more information about the ASeg and TSeg address ranges. 
        Each CPU access, directed at CPUAddr, is determined to be in the TSeg range if the following is true: 
        CPUAddr[47:17] & TSegMask[47:17] == TSegBase[47:17] & TSegMask[47:17]. 
        For example, if TSeg spans 256 KB and starts at the 1 MB address. The Core::X86::Msr::SMMAddr[TSegBase[47:17]] 
        would be set to 0010_0000h and the Core::X86::Msr::SMMMask[TSegMask[47:17]] to FFFC_0000h (with zeros filling 
        in for bits[16:0]). This results in a TSeg range from 0010_0000 to 0013_FFFFh.
