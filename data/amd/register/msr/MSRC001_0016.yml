        MSRC001_001[6...8] [IO Range Base] (Core::X86::Msr::IORR_BASE)

        Core::X86::Msr::IORR_BASE and Core::X86::Msr::IORR_MASK combine to specify the two sets of base and mask 
        pairs for two IORR ranges. A core access, with address CPUAddr, is determined to be within IORR address range if the 
        following equation is true: 
        
        CPUAddr[47:12] & PhyMask[47:12] == PhyBase[47:12] & PhyMask[47:12]. 
        BIOS can use the IORRs to create an IO hole within a range of addresses that would normally be mapped to DRAM. It 
        can also use the IORRs to re-assert a DRAM destination for a range of addresses that fall within a bigger IO hole that 
        overlays DRAM.
