        MSRC001_0111 [SMM Base Address] (Core::X86::Msr::SMM_BASE)

        This holds the base of the SMM memory region. The value of this register is stored in the save state on entry into SMM 
        (see 2.1.8.1.5 [SMM Save State]) and it is restored on returning from SMM. The 16-bit CS (code segment) selector is 
        loaded with SmmBase[19:4] on entering SMM. SmmBase[3:0] is required to be 0. The SMM base address can be 
        changed in two ways: 
        
        • The SMM base address, at offset FF00h in the SMM state save area, may be changed by the SMI handler. The 
        RSM instruction updates SmmBase with the new value. 
        • Normal WRMSR access to this register.
