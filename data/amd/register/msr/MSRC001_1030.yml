        MSRC001_1030 [IBS Fetch Control] (Core::X86::Msr::IBS_FETCH_CTL)

        The IBS fetch sampling engine is described as follows: 
        • The periodic fetch counter is an internal 20-bit counter: 
        • The periodic fetch counter [19:4] is set to IbsFetchCnt[19:4] and the periodic fetch counter [3:0] is set 
        according to IbsRandEn when IbsFetchEn is changed from 0 to 1. 
        • It increments for every fetch cycle that completes when IbsFetchEn == 1 and IbsFetchVal == 0. 
        • The periodic fetch counter is undefined when IbsFetchEn == 0 or IbsFetchVal == 1. 
        • When IbsFetchCnt[19:4] is read it returns the current value of the periodic fetch counter [19:4]. 
        • When the periodic fetch counter reaches {IbsFetchMaxCnt[19:4],0h} and the selected instruction fetch 
        completes or is aborted: 
        • IbsFetchVal is set to 1. 
        • Drivers can't assume that IbsFetchCnt[19:4] is 0 when IbsFetchVal == 1. 
        • The status of the operation is written to the IBS fetch registers (this register, 
        Core::X86::Msr::IBS_FETCH_LINADDR and Core::X86::Msr::IBS_FETCH_PHYSADDR). 
        • An interrupt is generated as specified by Core::X86::Msr::IBS_CTL. The interrupt service routine associated 
        with this interrupt is responsible for saving the performance information stored in IBS execution registers.
