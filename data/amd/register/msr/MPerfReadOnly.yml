        MSRC000_00E7 [Read-Only Max Performance Frequency Clock Count] (Core::X86::Msr::MPerfReadOnly) 
        
        MPerfReadOnly: read-only maximum core clocks counter. Reset: 0000_0000_0000_0000h. Incremented by 
        hardware at the P0 frequency while the core is in C0. In combination with Core::X86::Msr::APerfReadOnly, this 
        is used to determine the effective frequency of the core. A read of this MSR in guest mode is affected by 
        Core::X86::Msr::TscRateMsr. This field uses software P-state numbering. See 
        Core::X86::Msr::HWCR[EffFreqCntMwait], 2.1.2 [Effective Frequency]. This register is not affected by writes to 
        Core::X86::Msr::MPERF
