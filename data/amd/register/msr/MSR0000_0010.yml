       MSR0000_0010 [Time Stamp Counter] (Core::X86::Msr::TSC)
       
       The TSC uses a common reference for all sockets, cores and threads. 

       TSC: time stamp counter. Read-write,Volatile. Reset: 0000_0000_0000_0000h. The TSC increments at the P0 
       frequency. The TSC counts at the same rate in all P-states, all C states, S0, or S1. A read of this MSR in guest 
       mode is affected by Core::X86::Msr::TscRateMsr. The value (TSC/TSCRatio) is the TSC P0 frequency based 
       value (as if TSCRatio == 1.0) when (TSCRatio != 1.0)
