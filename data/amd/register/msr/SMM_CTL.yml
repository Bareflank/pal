       The bits in this register are processed in the order of: SmmEnter, SmiCycle, SmmDismiss, RsmCycle and SmmExit. 
       However, only the following combination of bits may be set in a single write (all other combinations result in undefined 
       behavior): 
       
       • SmmEnter and SmiCycle. 
       • SmmEnter and SmmDismiss. 
       • SmmEnter, SmiCycle and SmmDismiss. 
       • SmmExit and RsmCycle. 
       
       Software is responsible for ensuring that SmmEnter and SmmExit operations are properly matched and are not nested.
