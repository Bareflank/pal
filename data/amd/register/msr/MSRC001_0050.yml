        MSRC001_005[0...3] [IO Trap] (Core::X86::Msr::SMI_ON_IO_TRAP)
        
        Core::X86::Msr::SMI_ON_IO_TRAP and Core::X86::Msr::SMI_ON_IO_TRAP_CTL_STS provide a mechanism for 
        executing the SMI handler if a an access to one of the specified addresses is detected. Access address and access type 
        checking is performed before IO instruction execution. If the access address and access type match one of the specified 
        IO address and access types, then: (1) the IO instruction is not executed; (2) any breakpoint, other than the single-step 
        breakpoint, set on the IO instruction is not taken (the single-step breakpoint is taken after resuming from SMM); and (3) 
        issue the SMI-trigger IO cycle specified by Core::X86::Msr::SmiTrigIoCycle if enabled. The status is stored in 
        Core::X86::Smm::LocalSmiStatus[IoTrapSts]. 
        
        IO-space configuration accesses are special IO accesses. An IO access is defined as an IO-space configuration access 
        when IO instruction address bits[31:0] are CFCh, CFDh, CFEh, or CFFh when IO-space configuration is enabled 
        (IO::IoCfgAddr[ConfigEn]). The access address for a configuration space access is the current value of 
        IO::IoCfgAddr[BusNo,Device,Function,RegNo]. The access address for an IO access that is not a configuration access is 
        equivalent to the IO instruction address, bits[31:0]. 
        The access address is compared with SmiAddr, and the instruction access type is compared with the enabled access types 
        defined by ConfigSMI, SmiOnRdEn, and SmiOnWrEn. Access address bits[23:0] can be masked with SmiMask. IO and 
        configuration space trapping to SMI applies only to single IO instructions; it does not apply to string and REP IO 
        instructions. The conditional GP fault described by Core::X86::Msr::HWCR[IoCfgGpFault] takes priority over this trap.
