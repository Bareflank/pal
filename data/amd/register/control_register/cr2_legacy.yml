    This register is used by the page-translation mechanism. It is loaded by the processor with 
    the page-fault virtual address when a page-fault exception occurs.


    The virtual (linear) address that caused the #PF is stored in the CR2 register. The 
    legacy CR2 register is 32 bits long. The CR2 register in the AMD64 architecture is 64 bits long, as 
    shown in Figure 8-1 on page 234. In AMD64 implementations, when either software or a page fault 
    causes a write to the CR2 register, only the low-order 32 bits of CR2 are used in legacy mode; the 
    processor clears the high-order 32 bits.
