    This register contains additional controls for various operating-mode features.

    The CR4 register is shown in Figure 3-7. In legacy mode, the CR4 register is identical to the low 32 
    bits of the register (CR4 bits 31:0). The features controlled by the bits in the CR4 register are modelspecific extensions. Except for the performance-counter extensions (PCE) feature, software can use 
    the CPUID instruction to verify that each feature is supported before using that feature. See 
    Section 3.3 “Processor Feature Identification,” on page 64 for information on using the CPUID 
    instruction

                  Bit 7. When page translation is enabled, system-software performance 
                  can often be improved by making some page translations global to all tasks and procedures. Setting 
                  PGE to 1 enables the global-page mechanism. Clearing this bit to 0 disables the mechanism. 
                  
                  When PGE is enabled, system software can set the global-page (G) bit in the lowest level of the page- 
                  translation hierarchy to 1, indicating that the page translation is global. Page translations marked as 
                  global are not invalidated in the TLB when the page-translation-table base address (CR3) is updated. 
                  When the G bit is cleared, the page translation is not global. All supported physical-page sizes also 
                  support the global-page mechanism. See Section 5.5.2 “Global Pages,” on page 146 for information
