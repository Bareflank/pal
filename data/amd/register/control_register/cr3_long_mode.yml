    Control Register 3 (CR3)â€”Legacy-Mode Non-PAE Paging

    The CR3 register is used to point to the base address of the highest-level page-translation table. The 
    base address is either the page-directory pointer table or the page directory table. The CR3 register  
    format depends on the form of paging being used.

                The Process Context Identifier (PCID) feature allows a logical processor to cache TLB mappings
                concurrently for multiple virtual address spaces. When enabled (by setting CR4.PCIDE=1), the 
                processor associates the current 12-bit PCID with each TLB mapping it creates. Only entries matching 
                the current PCID are used when performing address translations. In this way, the processor may retain 
                cached TLB mappings for multiple contexts. 
                
                The current PCID is the value in CR3[11:0]. When PCIDs are enabled the system software can store 
                12-bit Process Context Identifiers in CR3 for different address spaces. Subsequently, when system 
                software switches address spaces (by writing the page table base pointer in CR3[62:12]), the processor 
                may use TLB mappings previously stored for that address space and PCID. A MOV to CR4 that clears 
                CR4.PCIDE causes all cached entries in the TLB for the logical processor to be invalidated. When 
                PCIDs are not enabled (CR4.PCIDE=0) the current PCID is always zero and all TLB mappings are 
                associated with PCID=0. 
                
                Attempting to set CR4.PCIDE with a MOV to CR4 if EFER.LMA = 0 or CR3[11:0] <> 0 causes in a 
                #GP exception. Attempting to clear CR0.PG with a MOV to CR0 if CR4.PCIDE is set causes a #GP 
                exception. The presence of PCID functionality is indicated by CPUID Function 1, ECX[PCID]=1.
