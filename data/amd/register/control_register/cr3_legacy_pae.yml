    Control Register 3 (CR3)—Legacy-Mode Non-PAE Paging

    The CR3 register is used to point to the base address of the highest-level page-translation table. The 
    base address is either the page-directory pointer table or the page directory table. The CR3 register  
    format depends on the form of paging being used.

                  Bit 3. Page-level writethrough indicates whether the highest- 
                  level page-translation table has a writeback or writethrough caching policy. When PWT=0, the table 
                  has a writeback caching policy. When PWT=1, the table has a writethrough caching policy.

                  This field points to the starting physical address of the highest-level

                  • This field is 27 bits and occupies bits 31:5. The CR3 register points to 
                  the base address of the page-directory-pointer table. The page-directory-pointer table is aligned on 
                  a 32-byte boundary, with the low 5 address bits 4:0 assumed to be 0.
