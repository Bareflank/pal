    This register is used by the page-translation mechanism. It is loaded by the processor with 
    the page-fault virtual address when a page-fault exception occurs.


    The virtual (linear) address that caused the #PF is stored in the CR2 register. The 
    legacy CR2 register is 32 bits long. The CR2 register in the AMD64 architecture is 64 bits long, as 
    shown in Figure 8-1 on page 234. In AMD64 implementations, when either software or a page fault 
    causes a write to the CR2 register, only the low-order 32 bits of CR2 are used in legacy mode; the 
    processor clears the high-order 32 bits.

                  Error Code Returned. The page-fault error code is pushed onto the page-fault exception-handler 
                  stack. See Section “Page-Fault Error Code” on page 239 for a description of this error code. 
                  
                  Program Restart. \#PF is a fault-type exception. In most cases, the saved instruction pointer points to 
                  the instruction that caused the \#PF. See Section “Exceptions During a Task Switch” on page 238 for a 
                  description of what can happen if this exception occurs during a task switch.
