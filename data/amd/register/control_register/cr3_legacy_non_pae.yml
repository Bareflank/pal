    Control Register 3 (CR3)—Legacy-Mode Non-PAE Paging

    The CR3 register is used to point to the base address of the highest-level page-translation table. The 
    base address is either the page-directory pointer table or the page directory table. The CR3 register  
    format depends on the form of paging being used.

                  Bit 3. Page-level writethrough indicates whether the highest- 
                  level page-translation table has a writeback or writethrough caching policy. When PWT=0, the table 
                  has a writeback caching policy. When PWT=1, the table has a writethrough caching policy.

                  This field points to the starting physical address of the highest-level

                  • Normal (Non-PAE) Paging (CR4.PAE=0)—This 20-bit field occupies bits 31:12, and points to the 
                  base address of the page-directory table. The page-directory table is aligned on a 4-Kbyte 
                  boundary, with the low-order 12 address bits 11:0 assumed to be 0. This yields a total base-address 
                  size of 32 bits.
