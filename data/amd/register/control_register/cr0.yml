                  Software forces all x87 instructions to cause a device-not-
                  available exception (#NM) by setting EM to 1. Likewise, setting EM to 1 forces an invalid-opcode
                  exception (#UD) when an attempt is made to execute any of the 64-bit or 128-bit media instructions 
                  except the FXSAVE and FXRSTOR instructions. Attempting to execute these instructions when EM is 
                  set results in an NM exception instead.The exception handlers can emulate these instruction types if 
                  desired. Setting the EM bit to 1 does not cause an NM exception when the WAIT/FWAIT instruction  
                  is executed.

                  When an attempt is made to execute an x87 or media instruction 
                  while TS=1, a device-not-available exception (#NM) occurs. Software can use this mechanism— 
                  sometimes referred to as “lazy context-switching”—to save the unit contexts before executing the next 
                  instruction of those types. As a result, the x87 and media instruction-unit contexts are saved only when 
                  necessary as a result of a task switch.

                  When a hardware task switch occurs, TS is automatically set to 1. System software that implements 
                  software task-switching rather than using the hardware task-switch mechanism can still use the TS bit 
                  to control x87 and media instruction-unit context saves. In this case, the task-management software 
                  uses a MOV CR0 instruction to explicitly set the TS bit to 1 during a task switch. Software can clear 
                  the TS bit by either executing the CLTS instruction or by writing to the CR0 register directly. Long- 
                  mode system software can use this approach even though the hardware task-switch mechanism is not 
                  supported in long mode.

                  Clearing the NE bit to 0 disables internal control of x87 floating-point 
                  exceptions and enables external control. When NE is cleared to 0, the IGNNE# input signal controls  
                  whether x87 floating-point exceptions are ignored:

                  When IGNNE# is 1, x87 floating-point exceptions are ignored. 
                  When IGNNE# is 0, x87 floating-point exceptions are reported by setting the FERR# input signal
                  to 1. External logic can use the FERR# signal as an external interrupt.

                  When NE is set to 1, internal control over x87 floating-point exception reporting is enabled and the 
                  external reporting mechanism is disabled. It is recommended that software set NE to 1. This enables 
                  optimal performance in handling x87 floating-point exceptions.

                  is set to 1, no new data or instructions are brought into the internal caches. However, the processor still  
                  accesses the internal caches when CD = 1 under the following situations:

                  Reads that hit in an internal cache cause the data to be read from the internal cache that reported the 
                  hit. 

                  Writes that hit in an internal cache cause the cache line that reported the hit to be written back to 
                  memory and invalidated in the cache.

                  Cache misses do not affect the internal caches when CD = 1. Software can prevent cache access by 
                  setting CD to 1 and invalidating the caches.
