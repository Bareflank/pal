    CPUID_Fn00000001_EAX [Family, Model, Stepping Identifiers] (Core::X86::Cpuid::FamModStep)

    Read-only. Reset: 0080_0FX2h. 
    
    Core::X86::Cpuid::FamModStep and Core::X86::Cpuid::FamModStepExt return the same value. 
    Family is an 8-bit value and is defined as: Family[7:0]=({0000b,BaseFamily[3:0]}+ExtendedFamily[7:0]).
    • E.g., If BaseFamily[3:0] == Fh and ExtendedFamily[7:0] == 08h, then Family[7:0] = 17h
    Model is an 8-bit value and is defined as: Model[7:0]={ExtendedModel[3:0],BaseModel[3:0]}.
    • E.g., If ExtendedModel[3:0] == 1h and BaseModel[3:0] == 8h, then Model[7:0] = 18h.
    • Model numbers vary with product.

    Model numbers are are assigned a letter, 0h = "A", 1h = "B", and so on. Model and Stepping form the Revision. E.g., B2.
