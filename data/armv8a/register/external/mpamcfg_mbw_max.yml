  purpose: |
       "
       MPAMCFG_MBW_MAX is a 32-bit read-write register that controls the
       maximum fraction of memory bandwidth that the PARTID selected by
       MPAMCFG_PART_SEL is permitted to use. A PARTID that has used more than
       MAX is given no access to additional bandwidth if HARDLIM == 1 or is
       given additional bandwidth only if there are no requests from PARTIDs
       that have not exceeded their MAX if HARDLIM == 0.
